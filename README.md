E-commerce Data Simulator
üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the E-commerce Data Simulator! This project is a powerful, configurable tool designed to generate realistic user interaction data for an e-commerce website. Inspired by platforms like Google Analytics, it provides a robust stream of events - from page views to purchases - that can be used to test data pipelines, build analytics dashboards, and train machine learning models.

The primary goal is to create a flexible and scalable simulation environment that mimics real-world user behavior, allowing developers and data analysts to work with high-quality, high-volume data without relying on actual production traffic.

‚ú® Features
Dynamic Event Simulation: Generate a wide variety of user events, including:

Website Visits (new and returning users)

Page Views (home, category, product pages)

Product Impressions

Adding/Removing Products from Cart

Initiating and Completing Checkout

Adding Products to Wishlists

User Sign-ups and Logins

High Configurability: Easily customize the simulation parameters to fit your needs.

Product Catalog: Define your own products, categories, and pricing via a simple configuration file (e.g., products.json).

User Personas: Simulate different types of users (e.g., "Bargain Hunter," "Brand Loyalist," "Casual Browser") with distinct behavioral patterns.

Behavior Control: Adjust the rate of events, session durations, and conversion funnels.

Scalable Data Streaming: Built with Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams to handle high-throughput, real-time data flow, ensuring the system can scale to millions of events.

Database Integration: Persist the generated data into a relational database of your choice. Configure the database connection string and let the simulator populate your tables.

Modular Architecture: The project is divided into clear modules (e-g., data-generator, data-persister, config-manager) to make it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

üîÆ Upcoming Features
Real-time Dashboard: A web-based interface to visualize the simulated data as it's generated.

Advanced Analytics: Integration with analytics tools to perform cohort analysis, funnel analysis, and more.

Anomaly Detection: Simulate unusual user behavior or system events (e.g., sudden traffic spikes, payment failures) to test monitoring systems.

A/B Testing Simulation: Model A/B tests by directing different user segments to different product variations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Core: Java 21+

Framework: Spring Boot 3

Messaging: Apache Kafka / Kafka Streams

Database: Support for any JPA-compatible database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2, etc.)

Build Tool: Maven

üèÅ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java 21

Docker (for running Kafka and a database)

Installation & Running
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-data-simulator.git
cd ecommerce-data-simulator

Start the infrastructure (Kafka & Database):

docker-compose up -d

Configure the application:

Edit src/main/resources/application.yml to set up your database connection.

Modify src/main/resources/products.json to define your product catalog.

Adjust src/main/resources/simulation.properties to control the simulation behavior.

Build and run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run

The simulator will now start generating data and sending it to the configured Kafka topics and database.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The simulation's behavior is primarily controlled by the simulation.properties file. Here are some of the key parameters you can tweak:

# Number of concurrent users to simulate
simulation.users.concurrent=100

# Rate of new events per second
simulation.events.rate=50

# Conversion rate from viewing a product to adding it to the cart
simulation.funnel.addToCartRate=0.10

# Conversion rate from cart to completed checkout
simulation.funnel.purchaseRate=0.05

For a full list of configurable parameters, please see the simulation.properties file.
